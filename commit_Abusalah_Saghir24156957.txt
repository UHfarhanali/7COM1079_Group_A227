Commit Message: Uploaded Shopping_CustomerData.csv dataset


Commit 2 : 
Detailed breakdown of the actual work in Analysis.R
	1.	Defined the purpose of the script

# Purpose: Perform the statistical test and interpret the hypothesis test results.

Abu-Salah added a clear header so anyone opening the file knows this script is responsible for the hypothesis testing part of the project.


2.	Loaded the dataset from CSV
shopping_data <- read.csv("Shopping_CustomerData.csv")
	•	Reads the file Shopping_CustomerData.csv into R.
	•	Stores it in a data frame called shopping_data.
	•	This makes all variables (Gender, AnnualIncome, etc.) available for further analysis.


	3.	Ran the Welch Two-Sample t-test for the Research Question
t_test_result <- t.test(AnnualIncome ~ CustomerGender,
                        data = shopping_data,
                        var.equal = FALSE)

	•	Uses the formula AnnualIncome ~ CustomerGender to compare mean income between Male and Female customers.
	•	var.equal = FALSE specifies Welch’s t-test, which does not assume equal variances (more robust and appropriate here).
	•	The full output (t-statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, confidence interval, group means) is stored in t_test_result.



	4.	Printed the test results in a readable way

print("--- T-Test Results ---")
print(t_test_result)

	•	Prints a header line and then the full t-test object.
	•	This gives all numeric details used later in the written report.



	5.	Extracted the p-value and formatted it
p_value <- t_test_result$p.value
cat("\nP-value:", format(p_value, scientific = FALSE), "\n")

	•	Pulls out the p-value from the test result.
	•	Prints it in non-scientific notation so it is easy to read and report.


	6.	Automatic hypothesis conclusion (Reject / Do not reject H₀)
if (p_value < 0.05) {
  cat("Conclusion: Reject the Null Hypothesis (Significant difference found).\n")
} else {
  cat("Conclusion: Do not reject the Null Hypothesis (No significant difference).\n")
}

	•	Compares the p-value with the standard α = 0.05 threshold.
	•	If p < 0.05 → prints “Reject the Null Hypothesis”.
	•	If p ≥ 0.05 → prints “Do not reject the Null Hypothesis”.
	•	This is exactly the logic used in the written report conclusion.

Overview : 
Created Analysis.R, which loads the dataset, runs Welch’s t-test on Annual Income by gender, extracts the p-value, and prints an automatic hypothesis test conclusion.
